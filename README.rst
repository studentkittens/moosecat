It's moosetastic_!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh wow, *another* MPD Client?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep!

There are only 240 (`ÃŒ counted them`_) client out there
So here's our little contribution to get up to 256 clients.

Features/Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since moosecat is a full featured client, we only list the special features, 
that only a few other clients have. 

    * Database Caching: **Fast** and intellgigent searching.
    * Playlist Manipulation in the style of `mpdc`_
    * Good on Ressouces: Performance-critical stuff is written in C.

.. note:: Quite some features need to be implemented still.



Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source is well annotated, but there's no user documentation yet.
Come back when it's done.
