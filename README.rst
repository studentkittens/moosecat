#############################
OH WOW, *ANOTHER* MPD CLIENT?
#############################

Yep!

There are only 240 (`I counted them`_) client out there.
So here's our little contribution to get up to 256 clients.

FEATURES/GOALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since moosecat is a full featured clients, we only list the special features, 
that only a few other clients have. 

* **Database Caching.**
  
    **Fast** and intellgigent searching.

    A SQLite cache is built on startup, and is used instead of MPD's internal
    search commands. On the next startup it is loaded from disk which is a lot
    faster. 

* **Playlist Manipulation in the style of `mpdc`_.**

    It is not exactly sure yet how this will be implemented, but 
    it should not be a large problem 

* **Good on Ressouces: Performance-critical stuff is written in C.**

    Even while the database sounds like poor memory usage, it is quite
    efficient! Only ~11MB is used for the database, which can be stored
    in memory or on disk - as the user likes. When moosecat shuts down, 
    it is also able to compress the database to ~2MB.

* **Plugins!**

    Moosecat sports an awesome Tag-based Plugin System, that is easy to use and understand.
    Every extended feature can be enabled or disabled as the user likes. 

* **GUI-Agnostic.**

    All MPD related code and all plugins are located in the core. 
    The core itself is partly written in C (*libmoosecat*) and partly
    in Cython. A PyGtk-GUI or an Ncurses-UI might be written relatively
    easy and share a lot code with each else.

* **Strong Emphasis on Tests**

    The current goal is to develop a *mpc* client as first milestone, which
    is very well tested by automated unittests. 

* **Python**

    The fact that it's mostly written in Python is a feature itself. â˜»
