It's moosetastic_!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh wow, *another* MPD Client?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep!

There are only 240 (`ÃŒ counted them`_) client out there
So here's our little contribution to get up to 256 clients.

Features/Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since moosecat is a full featured client, we only list the special features, 
that only a few other clients have. 

* Database Caching: **Fast** and intellgigent searching.

  A SQLite cache is built on startup, and is used instead of MPD's internal
  search commands. On the next startup it is loaded from disk which is a lot
  faster. 

* Playlist Manipulation in the style of `mpdc`_.

  It is not exactly sure yet how this will be implemented, but 
  it should not be a large problem 

* Good on Ressouces: Performance-critical stuff is written in C.

  Even while the database sounds like poor memory usage, it is quite
  efficient! Only ~11MB is used for the database, which can be stored
  in memory or on disk - as the user likes. When moosecat shuts down, 
  it is also able to compress the database to ~2MB.

* Plugins!

  Moosecat sports an awesome Plugin System, that is easy to use and understand.
  Every extended feature can be enabled or disabled as the user likes. 

* GUI-Agnostic.

  All MPD related code and all plugins are located in the core. 
  The core itself is partly written in C (*libmoosecat*) and partly
  in Cython.



.. note:: Quite some features need to be implemented still.



Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source is well annotated, but there's no user documentation yet.
Come back when it's done.
