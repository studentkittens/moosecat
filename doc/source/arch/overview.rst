    :alt: Overview on Moosecat's architecture.

Moosecat is split in several layers. Each layer has it's own duty and you will 
most likely only use the most outer one.

Some description that should get you started: 

libmpdclient
------------

* Third party library used by many other clients. 
* Provides low-level socket communication to MPD and basic structures like
  ``mpd_song``, ``mpd_status``, ``mpd_output``...

libmoosecat
-----------

* Written in C99.
* Uses ``libmpdclient`` to talk to MPD.
* Offers two connection methods: 
    
    1) Use two connections, one for events and for commands.
    2) Use one connection, switch between modes with MPD's ``idle`` command.

* Implements a Songstore with SQLite that mirrors MPD's Database.
* Provides fast searching via SQLite's FullTextSearch Extension.
* Tries to minimize communication. (Longer startup time as tradeoff)
* Offers an easy to use API that could be used also in other projects.
* Provides signals to dispatch events.
* Event mechanism relies on Glib's mainloop, normal client can run without
  "manually driven".
* Wraps ``libmpdclients`` commands.


Cython part
-----------

* Wraps ``libmoosecat`` API in a pythonic manner.
* Code resides in ``moosecat/core/*.pyx``.
* Gets compiled to a single ``.c`` file, which is compiled in turn and linked to
  libmoosecat.
* Simple Usage Example: ::

    >>> import moosecat.core as m
    >>> client = m.Client()
    >>> if client.connect(host="localhost", port=6666):
    ...     client.player_next()
    ...     print(client.status)
    ... 
    >>> client.disconnect()

Python Core
-----------

* All layers below are written in a very generic way, that could be used by any
  MPD Client. This layer implements the first stuff being specific to moosecat.
* Provides things like ``config``, ``logging``, ``boot`` and most importantly
  the plugin system. It basically sets up all the things to get started for you.

Deployment

Will be hard. â˜º

Need yet to figure out what the best way will be.
