libmoosecat 
-----------

- fix destroyage of UpdateData (test_status_timer bug)
- valgrind it
- Make client/store failsafe in case of connection loss
  - Chances are getting better, 
    but lots of testing needed with store
- Clean up API, Make README.docs
- Update cython wrapper (Oof)
- Write finally some tests for the Store? Still not 100% sure it will work
  with all configurations. Especially when output buffer is too large.
- Make MPD Devs include a ``plchangesposidfile`` command. ``plchanges`` 
  kills the startup time more than I'd accept (especially since that's a very
  easy patch...).
