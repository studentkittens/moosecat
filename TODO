libmoosecat 
-----------

Near-Term:
    - Command List support not working (Grrrr.)
    - update.c (Very tricky)
    - Update cython wrapper (Oof)


- Make libmoosecat fully threadsafe. (Although it should be already.)
- Make client/store failsafe in case of connection loss

- Fix the f@@king buildsystem.. why does it keep compiling moose.c always?
- Write finally some tests for the Store? Still not 100% sure it will work
  with all configurations. Especially when output buffer is too large.
- Make MPD Devs include a ``plchangesposidfile`` command. ``plchanges`` 
  kills the startup time more than I'd accept (especially since that's a very
  easy patch...).
- rethink signals. really.
- Split Queue in seperate table. Fixes problem with duplicate songs in Queue...
  (Same algorithm with stored playlist, just more lightweight)
