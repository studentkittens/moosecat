libmoosecat 
-----------

- self->con mutex idle-core.c deadlocks // DONE
- bettern db loading in store (different dbs with different host:ports)

- valgrind it
- Make client/store failsafe in case of connection loss
  - Chances are getting better, 
    but lots of testing needed with store

- Clean up API, make some sphinx documentation

- Update cython wrapper (Oof)

- Write finally some tests for the Store? Still not 100% sure it will work
  with all configurations. Especially when output buffer is too large.

- Make MPD Devs include a ``plchangesposidfile`` command. ``plchanges`` 
  kills the startup time more than I'd accept (especially since that's a very
  easy patch...).

-----

- Make libmoosecat fully threadsafe // DONE
- Implement mc_data_open()/mc_data_close() // DONE (Reverted...)
- Make outputs.c use a HashMap for gods sake.. // DONE
- Split Queue in seperate table. Fixes problem with duplicate songs in Queue...
  (Same algorithm with stored playlist, just more lightweight) // DONE
- remove g_print messages // DONE
- Look a lot at the section marked with TODO // DONE
- remove print messages while createing store // DONE
- revert introduction of currentsong.c/status.c/statistics.c // DONE
- mc_proto_ -> mc_ ? // DONE
