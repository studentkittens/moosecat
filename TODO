libmoosecat 
-----------

- Make libmoosecat fully threadsafe -- DONE. Well, almost.
- Make client/store failsafe in case of connection loss

- Clean up API, make some sphinx documentation
- Split Queue in seperate table. Fixes problem with duplicate songs in Queue...
  (Same algorithm with stored playlist, just more lightweight)
- Update cython wrapper (Oof)
- Write finally some tests for the Store? Still not 100% sure it will work
  with all configurations. Especially when output buffer is too large.
- Make MPD Devs include a ``plchangesposidfile`` command. ``plchanges`` 
  kills the startup time more than I'd accept (especially since that's a very
  easy patch...).
