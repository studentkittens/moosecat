libmoosecat 
-----------

Near-Term:
    - Replace COMMAND with something more appropiate. Replace old impl.
        - Read through:
            
            - protocol.c
            - client-command-list.c
            - update.c
            - store/db.c
            - store/db-private.c
            - store/db-stored-playlist.c

    - Implement command_list with mc_JobManager.
    - Update cython wrapper
    - Replace job_id with long.


- Make libmoosecat fully threadsafe. (Although it should be already.)
- Make client/store failsafe in case of mpd crash/shutdown/connectionkill
- Update Cython Wrapper to reflect the changes.
- Make store operations cancellable.
- Rethink Prio in store operations.
- Fix the f@@king buildsystem.. why does it keep compiling moose.c always?
- Write finally some tests for the Store? Still not 100% sure it will work
  with all configurations. Especially when output buffer is too large.
- Make MPD Devs include a ``plchangesposidfile`` command. ``plchanges`` 
  kills the startup time more than I'd accept (especially since that's a very
  easy patch...).
- rethink signals. really.
- Split Queue in seperate table. Fixes problem with duplicate songs in Queue...
  (Same algorithm with stored playlist, just more lightweight)
